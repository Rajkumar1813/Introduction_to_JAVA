Write a program that takes a character as input and prints 1, 0, or -1 according to the following rules.


1, if the character is an uppercase alphabet (A - Z).
0, if the character is a lowercase alphabet (a - z).
-1, if the character is not an alphabet.


Example:
Input: Character is 'a'.

Output: 0

Explanation: The input character is lowercase, so our answer is 0.
Input format :
The only line contains a single character.


Output format :
The only line contains 1, 0, or -1 according to the above rules.
Sample Input 1 :
v


Sample Output 1 :
0


Explanation of Sample Input 1:
The input character is lowercase, so our answer is 0.


Sample Input 2 :
V


Sample Output 2 :
1


Sample Input 3 :
#


Sample Output 3 :
-1


Expected time complexity :
The expected time complexity is O(1).
